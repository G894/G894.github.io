This tool required Palisade Evolver to operate. The model is designed to optimise corrective maintenance tasks. In the model, has been designed to schedule a corrective maintenance task within 30 days after a failure occurred. there are few factor in the real world maintenance scheduling have been considered including: model of turbine, capacity factor, downtime cost rate, cost of vessel, cost of employee, weather. A literature review about current offshore wind development, proactive and reactive maintenance strategies, reliability of turbine in sea environment, has been undertaken. The research on the reducing maintenance task cost for offshore wind turbine had to separate in to two main areas proactive and corrective maintenance. During the research, the model has shown the capacity factor is a critical element during the optimisation, it will affect the downtime cost whatever the owner going to execute a maintenance, and the capacity factor is a seasonal floating factor, preventive maintenance should be scheduled more relate to the capacity factor pattern. For the corrective maintenance, the model also shown the booking cost is another critical issue. Sometime in the model the failure with requirement of expensive vessel, operator has to wait until vessel can be booked in a discount price to execute a maintenance task.\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/publications/msc/","tags":["线性规划","成本优化"],"title":"降低离岸风力发电机的维护与运行成本"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Abstract With the prosperous development of containerization and the world logistics, the competition between container ports has been undated. The number of throughput and container ship DWT are growing every year. However, the efficiency problem has become one of the elements affect the container port performance. The measurement of a successful container port/port company is more complicated. The throughput data is no longer the only point to measure a container port anymore. Under the efficiency concept, increase the performance by gaining more value from lesser input, has become the key in the container port competition.\nDEA also known as Data Envelopment Analysis, it was developed by Charnes (Charnes, Cooper and E. Rhode, 1978). Since last century DEA has been used in measuring organizational efficiency. With contribution of data envelopment analysis in the economic area, DEA has been used by different organization in their area.in recent years, it has become a famous analysis methods.\nIn this project a basic model in data envelopment analysis will be used to measure a set of samples. Several container ports/port company have been selected as the samples (DMUs), including Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Lianyungang and a port company called Guangxi Beibu international Port Group .Ltd (GBIPG .Ltd. The inputs are total berth length, total berths, and total berths with over 10,000DWT docking ability. Total throughput (Millions of TEUs) and total throughput (Millions of Tons) as the outputs. By the end of the case, all the results will be analysed and compared.\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/publications/bsc/","tags":["数据包络分析\"","EDA","港口效率"],"title":"利用数据包络分析衡量广西北部湾国际港务集团的港口效率"},{"categories":null,"contents":"该项目的在一开始并不如人意，Dracco的货物在撤出原合作工厂的过程中并没有得到妥善的整理，且Dracco方项目人员缺乏物流供应链相关的基础知识。\n在该情况下，项目工作展开困难。\n进入项目之后，我梳理货物特点，了解客户未来生产计划，在我的努力沟通下，该项目的运行也逐渐流畅。客户也深刻的意识到了仓库管理的重要性。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/dracco/","tags":["项目管理","仓储"],"title":"Dracco仓储项目主管"},{"categories":null,"contents":"在这个项目主要还是在协助项目负责人管理项目的同时学习这个项目的特点，并提出改进计划。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/staples/","tags":["项目管理","仓储"],"title":"深圳史泰博仓"},{"categories":null,"contents":"将我派到这个项目里主要是为了让我熟悉Kerry EAS Logistics的一些基本概况。\n在我了解了这整个项目的细节之后，该项目刚好面临了一个月左右的货损率增长。\n我通过对项目的了解主导了一些改进。并且出差前往潜在货损发生节点观察项目运营。随后该项目成功降低了货损率。\n在离开前针对该项目人员流动问题我提出了针对新入同事的培训计划，简短了新同事的培训时间。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/xiaomics/","tags":["项目管理","运输"],"title":"小米电视机逆向物流客服"},{"categories":null,"contents":"正文\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF/","tags":["项目管理","仓储"],"title":"标题"},{"categories":null,"contents":"该项目是集团在梅州的新的电商产业园，从人才培训到就业的产业链。 中方学校和德方学校在电子商务、汽车制造、物流及护理等专业开展全日制中德国际合作班,合作双方建立双毕业证培养模式。 1）与国内知名电商和达成了人才输送协议。 2）与德国物流联盟达成了合作协议。\n我在项目中\n建设完善项目内容并促成境内外学校与该孵化园的合作。 准备相关的政府补助申请资料。 担任摄影师为后期宣传储备材料。 翻译境外合作组织的材料。 校对公司宣传材料。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/meizhou/","tags":["有信达","项目管理"],"title":"梅州跨境电商孵化园"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026quot;contents\u0026quot;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
