The model is designed to optimise corrective maintenance tasks. In the model, has been designed to schedule a corrective maintenance task within 30 days after a failure occurred. there are few factor in the real world maintenance scheduling have been considered including: model of turbine, capacity factor, downtime cost rate, cost of vessel, cost of employee, weather.\nA literature review about current offshore wind development, proactive and reactive maintenance strategies, reliability of turbine in sea environment, has been undertaken. The research on the reducing maintenance task cost for offshore wind turbine had to separate in to two main areas proactive and corrective maintenance.\nDuring the research, the model has shown the capacity factor is a critical element during the optimization, it will affect the downtime cost whatever the owner going to execute a maintenance, and the capacity factor is a seasonal floating factor, preventive maintenance should be scheduled more relate to the capacity factor pattern.\nFor the corrective maintenance, the model also shown the booking cost is another critical issue. Sometime in the model the failure with requirement of expensive vessel, operator has to wait until vessel can be booked in a discount price to execute a maintenance task.\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/publications/msc/","tags":["线性规划","成本优化"],"title":"降低离岸风力发电机的维护与运行成本"},{"categories":null,"contents":" Abstract With the prosperous development of containerization and the world logistics, the competition between container ports has been undated. The number of throughput and container ship DWT are growing every year. However, the efficiency problem has become one of the elements affect the container port performance. The measurement of a successful container port/port company is more complicated. The throughput data is no longer the only point to measure a container port anymore. Under the efficiency concept, increase the performance by gaining more value from lesser input, has become the key in the container port competition.\nDEA also known as Data Envelopment Analysis, it was developed by Charnes (Charnes, Cooper and E. Rhode, 1978). Since last century DEA has been used in measuring organizational efficiency. With contribution of data envelopment analysis in the economic area, DEA has been used by different organization in their area.in recent years, it has become a famous analysis methods.\nIn this project a basic model in data envelopment analysis will be used to measure a set of samples. Several container ports/port company have been selected as the samples (DMUs), including Shanghai, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Lianyungang and a port company called Guangxi Beibu international Port Group .Ltd (GBIPG .Ltd. The inputs are total berth length, total berths, and total berths with over 10,000DWT docking ability. Total throughput (Millions of TEUs) and total throughput (Millions of Tons) as the outputs. By the end of the case, all the results will be analysed and compared.\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/publications/bsc/","tags":["数据包络分析\"","EDA","港口效率"],"title":"利用数据包络分析衡量广西北部湾国际港务集团的港口效率"},{"categories":null,"contents":"在该项目中，我独立负责处理Crabtree在华南地区的天猫电商产生的退货物流。\n该项目期间我通过与上下游同事的紧密联系，在维持项目高效运行的前提下，消除了数项冗余的工作流程。\n并以此为契机向部门提出了PSOM（Personal Stanard Operation Manual）-基于个人工作流的标准操作手册系统\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/crabtree/","tags":["项目管理","仓储"],"title":"瑰珀翠(Crabtree)护肤品售后逆向物流仓储"},{"categories":null,"contents":"该项目范围广，涉及全国多个地区，我参与的部分位于深圳区，涉及到各个机房之间网络设备的调拨。\n参与了该项目的高标准一线工作，货物内容包含而不限于:\n 核心交换机/交换机 服务器 硬盘 Access Point 服务器主板 条线  ","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/tencent/","tags":["运输"],"title":"腾讯网络设备调拨项目"},{"categories":null,"contents":"该项目的在一开始并不如人意，Dracco的货物在撤出原合作工厂的过程中并没有得到妥善的整理，货物分类杂乱，包装十分简易，且Dracco方项目人员缺乏物流供应链相关的基础知识。\n在该情况下，仓储项目工作展开困难。\n进入项目之后，我梳理货物特点，分类整理了库存，了解客户未来生产计划，在努力沟通与主动推进下，该项目的运行也逐渐流畅。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/dracco/","tags":["项目管理","仓储"],"title":"Dracco仓储项目"},{"categories":null,"contents":"在该项目中我独立管理着价值超过10万美元的库存，工作中使用了ERP与WMS与上下游进行对接。\n除了在进行日常的出入库管理之外，我还整理出原本该岗位不具备的PSOM（Personal Stanard Operation Manual），优化了该岗位的工作流程。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/sony/","tags":["项目管理","仓储","WMS"],"title":"索尼(Sony)商用投影仪供应链金融仓储项目"},{"categories":null,"contents":"通过对消费者数码产品的了解，我在该项目中作为客服人员为小米的加盟店提供了热情周到的客户服务。\n除了管理运输订单与监督第三方运输供应商之外，我还针对该项目的货损痛点进行了流程调查，成功定位并降低了货物破损率。\n在离开前针对该项目人员流动问题我提出了针对新入同事的培训计划，简短了新同事的培训时间。\n在项目中我负责\n 运输订单管理 运输供应商/车队监督 客户电话沟通  ","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/xiaomics/","tags":["项目管理","运输"],"title":"小米电视机逆向物流"},{"categories":null,"contents":"正文\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E6%A8%A1%E6%9D%BF/","tags":["项目管理","仓储"],"title":"标题"},{"categories":null,"contents":"曾经为公司申请过各类政府优惠政策，包括而不仅限于：\n 《2017-2018年度广东省电子商务示范企业》\n 《2017年度深圳市重点物流企业贷款贴息资助》\n 《2017年中央外经贸发展专项资金》\n 《物博会参展补助》\n 《2017广东省示范企业示范品牌》\n  最高单项补助超过人民币35万元。\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/yoursender/","tags":["有信达","政府补助"],"title":"政策补助与优惠申报"},{"categories":null,"contents":"该项目是集团在梅州的新的电商产业园，从人才培训到就业的产业链。 中方学校和德方学校在电子商务、汽车制造、物流及护理等专业开展全日制中德国际合作班,合作双方建立双毕业证培养模式。\n 与国内知名电商和达成了人才输送协议。 与德国物流联盟达成了合作协议。  我在项目中\n 建设完善项目内容并促成境内外学校与该孵化园的合作。 准备相关的政府补助申请资料。 担任摄影师为后期宣传储备材料。 翻译境外合作组织的材料。 校对公司宣传材料。  新闻链接\n","permalink":"https://g894.github.io/projects/creations/meizhou/","tags":["有信达","项目管理"],"title":"梅州跨境电商孵化园"},{"categories":null,"contents":" This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.\nNo content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html\nSetting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.\nThis implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js\nInitial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml\n[outputs] home = [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.\nEdit layouts/_default/index.JSON This exposes the values in /index.json i.e. add category\n... \u0026quot;contents\u0026quot;:{{ .Content | plainify | jsonify }} {{ if .Params.tags }}, \u0026quot;tags\u0026quot;:{{ .Params.tags | jsonify }}{{end}}, \u0026quot;categories\u0026quot; : {{ .Params.categories | jsonify }}, ...
