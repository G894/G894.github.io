      <description>Abstract The project presents an Excel based linear program model for operation and maintenance cost optimisation in offshore wind farm.
This tool required Palisade Evolver to operate. The model is designed to optimise corrective maintenance tasks. In the model, has been designed to schedule a corrective maintenance task within 30 days after a failure occurred. there are few factor in the real world maintenance scheduling have been considered including: model of turbine, capacity factor, downtime cost rate, cost of vessel, cost of employee, weather.</description>

      <description>Abstract With the prosperous development of containerization and the world logistics, the competition between container ports has been undated. The number of throughput and container ship DWT are growing every year. However, the efficiency problem has become one of the elements affect the container port performance. The measurement of a successful container port/port company is more complicated. The throughput data is no longer the only point to measure a container port anymore.</description>
